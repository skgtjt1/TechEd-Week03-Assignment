🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

- arguably it could have more/better styling

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- I found most of the javascript very hard, I had to ask for a lot of help and do a ton of google searching. Some important functions required debugging through GPT4 as well. The

(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

- I found the layout and styling fun and fairly simple, on the other hand, the javascript was extremely difficult. I almost didn't have a working app on time.
- I also found figuring out which functions to plug into the interval timer quite interesting but finding a way to only start the interval once on load or after a reset took ages. I went down a rabbit-hole of setting flags for app states which was helpful to learn.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).

- Emily and I shared a lot of ideas, she helped a great deal with handling the API which I was struggling with. StackExchange had some good solutions, such as window.onLoad that I was unaware of. GPT4 was helpful to catch bugs in the very large functions.

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

- Implementing a stop/reset button that allowed for the game to be restarted without refreshing the page was difficult.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
